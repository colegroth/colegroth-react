Plenty of films of this era explore the loudest and most exciting parts of the war, which usually consist of the senseless killing of German soldiers without any sense of nuance. But Nolan has a sense of respect and patriotism for the ordinary heroes of the war that makes it so far ahead of nearly any other film about the Second World War.", "Before I was into movies, I remember watching Dunkirk a few months after its theatrical run at a local dollar theater, and I didn't like it at all. I don't remember exactly what I didn't like about it, but I do remember being very frustrated at the whole thing. Years later, I rewatched it on my laptop, and as I have with every Christopher Nolan movie since, I fell in love with it. Being able to finally see it again in the theater has brought me a sense of understanding that you only get with the proper theatrical experience.", "The epistemological style of storytelling that Nolan takes makes every one of his films far more interesting than they might be on the surface. Hoyte van Hoytema\u2018s incredible cinematography somehow doesn't stand out nearly as much simply because of how phenomenal Hans Zimmer\u2018s score is. The relentless 105-minute score pulses through the entire film, bringing a sense of pacing so astounding that I checked my watch halfway through the movie and figured I must've accidentally set it ahead.", "All these little anecdotes aside, I think the thing I appreciate most about the film is Christopher Nolan's script, which explores the quiet complexities of war, including heroes and cowards, soldiers and villains. It poses a truly thought-provoking question: who do we become when we face our end? We see people acting through desperation, and yet the film seems to respect every one of its characters.", "I also love the way that the German soldiers are portrayed in the film, in that they are simply not given much portrayal at all. In some ways, you could be forgiven for thinking this is a Top Gun: Maverick-style situation where the enemy is purposely kept vague. Unlike Fury, which I despised for its portrayal of the soldiers in a way that was inhumane and one-dimensional, I appreciate the ways in which the enemy is portrayed here as this relentless and terrifying force of antagonism that is never given a face. It gets at the real point of war, which is not that all of these German soldiers deserve to die because the German army belonged to the Nazis, but instead that war makes monsters of us all, and it truly is the survival of the fittest. Portraying the Germans who get killed simply as these off-screen antagonists brings a level of fear and villainy to the Nazis as a whole, without having to shout in our face about their ideology.", "There is simply a way that Nolan manages to wrap up so many of his films on the most satisfying notes possible, and Dunkirk is no exception to that. I now feel comfortable adding this to my list of, in my opinion, perfect films. While it might not even be in the top five for Christopher Nolan, that is a comfortable reality for me, given my deep and enthusiastic appreciation for him and his contributions to the greatest medium of art."], "footerText": "Rent or buy on Apple TV", "footerLink": "https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/dunkirk/umc.cmc.2it70p9v99qf3s2gocv1bbt1r"}

It's cheapened the experience and robbed the narrative of its tension.", "That said, the explosion's still fun to watch. There's a primal satisfaction in watching wealthy, successful people absolutely wreck their lives over petty grievances. The inciting incident, where Theo has lost his job and his museum while Ivy\u2019s restaurant empire is taking off, is a classic setup for male insecurity. The film's leaning into the physical comedy of their hatred. Seeing them smash expensive heirlooms and destroy drywall acts as a catharsis for the audience.", "The supporting cast does some heavy lifting. Andy Samberg and Kate McKinnon act as a Greek Chorus to the madness. They've brought a surprising amount of sincerity to their roles. They're reacting the way we'd react. They're horrified, but they can't look away. McKinnon's grounding the film. She's reminding us that these're real people destroying each other and aren't just cartoons.", "Ultimately, The Roses is a breakup movie that's taken things to the extreme. It's satirizing the way money will amplify our worst impulses. It's suggesting that love's a battlefield regardless of your tax bracket. It's entertaining and is very funny. It's got great actors having a good time. It just isn't essential. It's a disposable piece of entertainment that you'll enjoy for 105 minutes and'll forget immediately after. It's good for a laugh, but it won't save your marriage."], "footerText": "The Roses is in theaters now", "footerLink": "https://www.amazon.com/The-Roses-Olivia-Colman/dp/B0D5ROSES"}

I\u2019ve made it a tradition to start and end my year with a rewatch, so sitting down for this loop feels like checking in with an old friend who knows exactly where I\u2019ve been. This was my 475th film of the year, which is a bit of a dip from last year\u2019s 500, but life got a lot busier in 2025. Still, there\u2019s something comforting about the fact that no matter how much my own life changes, Nyles and Sarah are still stuck at that wedding, trying to figure out if anything actually matters.", "It\u2019s my number one movie of all time because it\u2019s a perfect machine. Every piece of it's just so endlessly exciting, from Andy Siara\u2019s razor-sharp script to the way Max Barbakow directs the hell out of the desert landscape. The chemistry between Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti is the engine that makes it run, but it\u2019s the existential weight behind the jokes that keeps me coming back. It\u2019s a film that understands that the real time loop isn\u2019t a magical vortex in a cave; it\u2019s the terrifying realization that we have to wake up and be the same person every single day.", "Matthew Compton\u2019s score and Quyen Tran\u2019s cinematography give the film a vibrant, sun-drenched texture that masks the low-key melancholy at its core. It\u2019s the perfect loop, moving with a pacing that feels effort-less no matter how many times I\u2019ve memorized the beats. This rewatch was the final entry of my year, and as I close the book on 2025, I\u2019m reminded of why I love this medium so much. Movies like this give us a way to track our own growth against something that never changes. It was a busy year, sure, but ending it here makes the world seem a little less mundane."], "footerText": "Rent or buy on Apple TV", "footerLink": "https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/palm-springs/umc.cmc.249v99qf3s2gocv1bbt1r"}
