    "Following up on something as masterful as Parasite has to be one of the hardest tasks as a filmmaker. Bong Joon-ho's first feature in six years does a pretty good job at it by completely abandoning an attempt at making something as important as his magnum opus through his bonkers expiration of life-after-life a.k.a. Mickey 17.",
    "Starring Robert Pattinson with a goofy voice alongside Robert Pattinson with a less goofy voice, Mickey 17 follows... Mickey! The seventeenth version of Mickey, to be more specific. On a voyage led by a Trump-like failed congressional leader (played terrifically by a hilarious Mark Ruffalo), Mickey finds himself in the role of an expandable - a man who can be repeatedly killed for Science™.",
    "I found this to be a very funny time and a total riot in a large theater. Again, it lacks a lot of the merit that Parasite had in that I wasn't particularly blown away by most of the visuals, which rely heavily on CGI or studio-looking lighting. That said, the script, penned by Joon-ho based on a book of a similar name, is a ridiculously funny thing.",
    "There are lots of political parallels that people will draw from this, but it's very funny that these would all have been written in the event of Trump's failed presidential run, even though it's now released during his second administration. It's an interesting criticism of people like him and capitalism as a whole.",
    "There are a few quirky decisions that make this both better and worse. Some of the standouts are Tony Collette as an unbelievably hilarious second-in-command obsessed with sauce and Naomi Ackie as Pattinson's love interest who is instantly obsessed with the idea of having a threeway with clones of himself. Anamaria Vartolomei's inclusion as Kai is a rather bizarre role, as she comes in near the second act and makes no noticeable impact on the story.",
    "Ultimately, this feels about fifteen minutes too long and struggles heavily against its directorial predecessor, but is a ridiculously fun time in a theater that deserves a watch. Sadly, I bet this is going to bomb, and Joon-ho is going to have to wait six more years before making something as spectacular again. Here's hoping to neither!"
