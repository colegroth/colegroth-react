    "Well, I guess I've committed to starting and ending every year with Palm Springs! This is my 30th viewing! I've recently been trying to pick up new little details, like lines that I haven't heard before or little sounds that fill out the soundscape.",
    "One of the funny bits I haven't mentioned before in my reviews is when Nyles is explaining the loop to Sarah, and he offers her the same beer can three times in a few minutes. Funny stuff.",
    "I want to get through the MCU's Infinity Saga. I've seen almost every movie in it, but not within the last five years, which is the cutoff for me to leave a rating and review. That puts about 23 films on my watchlist.",
    "I want to watch absolutely EVERYTHING nominated at the Oscars this year. In years past, I got through the most important things but missed out on all documentaries and most international features. No more!",
    "I'll also watch 50 movies from that 100 years... 100 movies list that AFI puts out. I'm trying to expand my horizons!"
