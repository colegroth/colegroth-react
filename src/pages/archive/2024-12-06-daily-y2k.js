    "I quite enjoyed this silly, thrilly, and gorey film! There's been so much negative discourse surrounding Y2K, so even after being excited about it for months before its release, I missed it in theaters. It was a big mistake from me because if I had seen it in the proper format, I probably would've loved it even more. I'm a massive fan of Rachel Zegler and have loved every film and role she's taken on so far.",
    "Mooney is killing people left and right, and once the massacre begins, it feels like it keeps on going. It's a thrilling and disturbing scene to watch all of these shitty teenagers get brutally murdered by the technology, but importantly, it's funny! Mooney embraces its absurdities, making the film a whole lot better for it.",
    "I wasn't expecting several of the main characters to be killed off, but I think it speaks to the film's courage to let that happen. It's nice to see a horror/comedy that embraces the intensity of its premise. Jaeden Martell is a really solid lead. He's funny and charming, and I liked the romance between him and Zegler.",
    "They should've gotten together at the end, though! The other two, Daniel Zolghadri and Lachlan Watson, are also pretty good. I didn't know they would be the leads based on any of the trailers, and I think it's an interesting concept to bring in another pair of supporting characters after killing off your primary ones."
