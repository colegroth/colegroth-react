    "My God, Boy Kills World might have the worst use of voiceover ever in film. I'm not sure who decided that the Bob's Burgers guy should be the narrator for an otherwise inspired action flick, but his grating voice, combined with the horrific dialogue, makes this a very annoying experience for the most part.",
    "From the moment the narrator begins speaking, I am taken aback by how distracting it is. I don't even watch Bob's Burgers, but all I could think was, 'That's Bob!' whenever he spoke. It's just Bob saying something stupid every few minutes and cutting through any dramatic tension set up.",
    "The use of gore in this is so intense in a way I can appreciate, but ultimately too gross for its own good. Yeah, the cheese grater attack sequence is well done on a technical level, but it made me so uncomfortable that I almost wanted to stop the movie.",
    "Bill Skarsgård is entertaining as the leading guy. Since he has no dialogue, we focus much more on his physicality and the subtleties of his racial reactions, two things he's really good at. I wish they had given him the dialogue instead of the stupid narrator because he's a brilliant actor.",
    "I also really hated the use of post-credits stuff. We end the film on an ambiguous note where we don't know if Jessica Rothe's character survives, but once the credits are over, we find out the two of them alive. That's nice, but you CANNOT hold out on this information until the credits are over! Why the hell would you leave something so key to only be seen at the point in the movie where most people have left the theater? It's dumb."
