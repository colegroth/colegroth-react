    "It's been years since we've gotten an honest-to-goodness portrayal of vampires on the screen. After his enormous success with Black Panther and Creed, Ryan Coogler is ready to bring an original film to screens. Sinners is the perfect blockbuster—an audacious, exciting, funny, thrilling, scary, romantic, bloody, and sexy exploration of life in the 1930s South. This is an unforgettable big-screen experience and the best movie of the year so far.",
    "Sinners tells the story of two twins, Stack and Smoke (Jordan), who return to the American South in the early 1930s after striking it rich and working for the mob in Chicago. Determined to start a new business venture, they recruit their old friends, lovers, and other characters from around the town to engage in a night of celebration. Unbeknownst to them, a malevolent force is determined to wreak havoc.",
    "While Gen Z dreads seeing sex on screen, it's delightful to see how easily Coogler embraces it. It's an effortlessly seductive film, with every character finding an object of their arousal and making it very clear. Every sex scene is choreographed excellently, bringing a level of realness and charm that is often missing from big studio blockbusters like this.",
    "Unlike films of recent years, the vampires in Sinners play by all the classic rules of the bloodsuckers: needing permission to enter a house, burning in the sunlight, and an aversion to garlic are just a few of the weaknesses these vampires possess. It's a fun return to the classic mythology of a character type that has too often been treated like zombies.",
    "One of the key ways in which we explore this world is through music. The score, composed by a never-better Ludwig Göransson, underpins every scene with a complex blend of blues and folk that is tender and emotional but also thrilling and scary.",
    "On every technical level, this delivers. Not enough can be said about Autumn Durald Arkapaw's cinematography. Her use of the IMAX camera leads to some of the most breathtakingly beautiful shots of the year. It's edited to perfection by Michael Shawver and doesn't feel more than a second too long.",
    "The theatrical experience is all about celebrating good, original movies. In a landscape that's quickly being overrun with big IP and sequels, Ryan Coogler has directed one of the greatest theatrical experiences in ages. Sinners effortlessly balances so many genres and is a truly life-changing experience. Original movies should be celebrated, and there's no film more original than this."
