  verdict: "Style over substance, but worthwhile.",
  paragraphs: [
    "Oz Perkins' idiosyncratic follow-up to the disappointing Longlegs is The Monkey, a horror-comedy focused on the insanity of death. It's a surprisingly satisfying watch that falls flat on its messaging in an attempt to make some of the most creative kills of the year. It's style over substance, but ultimately a worthwhile watch.",
    "This is one of those films entirely dependent on whether I like the ending or not. Thankfully, this sticks it pretty nicely without losing focus on what it's really trying to be. I fully expected the dad and son to be brutally killed at the end, something I think the film is trying to go for with the last shot being so clearly framed to make it seem like a truck is going to wipe them out.",
    "Perkins is clearly trying to dig at some deeper themes of overcoming grief, but it's a little hard when the film is so snarky and sarcastic. I think the horror-comedy blend works a lot better because of that tone, but it stops the film from feeling like something more than a series of gruesome kills meant to invoke laughter and disgust.",
    "Much appreciation goes to the people who made the kills look as good as they did. Each one is pretty unique and manages to strike the perfect balance of being horrific and simultaneously hilarious to look at.",
    "I wonder if there's any future to this monkey. He's a pretty creepy little guy and potentially a new horror icon. I can't believe he hasn't been made into a horror figure for a long time now."
