  paragraphs: [
    "The last few minutes of Immaculate are some of the most captivating minutes in horror of the last few years. My jaw was on the floor by the time the credits were rolling, a magnificent achievement for a film I was watching haphazardly on my laptop.",
    "For the most part, I was able to zone out while the plot was going on. It's very standard fare as far as religious horror movies go. Nuns are scary. Religion is terrifying. Jump scares aplenty, some vague plot with old women being scary, and a super intense scene of our main character peeling off her fingernail? Yup, this is a scary movie in the 21st century, alright. Does it have much to say about religion? Maybe. I don't know if I was missing out on the commentary or if it wasn't there.",
    "There's something very special about this, though. None of the jump scares feel cheap, the production design is excellent, and Sydney Sweeney's performance is genuinely incredible. She's ridiculously captivating and gives a performance so good at the end that I think she should be in contention for awards.",
    "It's been a while since a horror movie has made me feel the way this does, and I think this is going to hold the test of time as an overlooked film. I can't wait to see what Sweeney does after this because she's proving to have some real range."
